# PIC_DC_discharge

This is the code used in the paper "A Conservative-Constrained Clustering-Merging Algorithm for Particle-in-Cell Codes" 
This is a 1D3V PIC code for DC discharge between parallel plates.

If merging is required, set "size_min" (greater than 'constraint_num') in the parameter_define, and ensure that a callable Python version of MATLAB is installed on your computer. Then, download and install the Constraint_k_means Python code from:  https://joshlk.github.io/k-means-constrained. For calling Python code from MATLAB, please refer toï¼šhttps://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/matlab_external/ways-to-call-python-from-matlab.html#mw_53c718f8-1bbb-49bd-a17a-344979a5878a

If merging is not required, remove the following two lines of code from do_one_cycle: [x_e,vx_e,vy_e,vz_e,WEIGHT_e]=merging(xN_e,xG_e,x_e,vx_e,vy_e,vz_e,WEIGHT_e,N_G,constraint_num,size_min) & [x_i,vx_i,vy_i,vz_i,WEIGHT_i]=merging(xN_i,xG_i,x_i,vx_i,vy_i,vz_i,WEIGHT_i,N_G,constraint_num,size_min)
